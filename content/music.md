In recent years, i played piano and wrote tunes for a jazz quintet, Nebula. Some recordings we made:

I also played piano, fiddle, and cajon for a contra dance band, [Pepperjack](https://www.facebook.com/pepperjackcontra/). We made an album in 2021:

There is also some video evidence of us playing [at Valley of the Moon fiddle camp in 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G5IXcXC5lg) and
[at the Silicon Valley Irish Fleadh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ywr0cNBv7w) the same year.

Way back in 2012, i wrote, recorded, and produced an album of my own compositions:

where i wrote pieces for chamber groups and orchestra, including:

- [Rhapsody for Orchestra](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15AZVhfc6ZBk0xg1NE3CtucS1VEJGXyLf/view),
