# Scott Jespersen

I am interested in working towards a more harmonious relationship between humans
and the rest of the natural world, especially as it pertains to energy. I have a
background in mathematics, software, and data science. I am also a pianist and
composer in a [jazz quintet](https://www.nebulajazz.com).

Recent (2020) M.S. graduate of [ICME](https://icme.stanford.edu/) at Stanford
University.
